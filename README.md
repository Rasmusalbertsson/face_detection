# MediaPipe Face Detection

This project is an implementation of a lazy-loaded face detection application using MediaPipe's Face Detection module and OpenCV. The application can process both static images and real-time video feeds from a webcam, applying face detection and annotations to the images and video frames.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Face detection model is loaded only when required for the first time to optimize resource usage.
- **Static Image Processing**: Process and annotate static images with detected faces.
- **Real-Time Webcam Detection**: Detect and annotate faces in real-time using a webcam.
- **Easy Integration**: Structured to be easily integrated and expanded within other projects.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

##Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

*   git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/mediapipe-face-detection.git
    *   cd mediapipe-face-detection

## Install dependencies:
---------------------------------

- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage:
---------------------------------
* Process Static Images:
    Add image paths to the IMAGE_FILES list in the main function and run the script to process the images. Processed images will be saved with annotations.
* Webcam Face Detection:
    Run the script and face detection will start using your webcam. Press ESC to exit webcam mode.
